# m77-raspberry-wifi-node-nmcli

> **This is the new module to configure WiFi networks from nodejs**

> **In current versions of Raspberry OS wpa_cli is no longer used, instead all network configuration is done through nmcli. For this reason the package ***m77-raspberry-wifi-node**** it is no longer used*
  
___
It is a module that I have developed in **node.js** to configure the Wi-Fi network of **Raspberry Pi** that uses **nmcli**.
___
**Implementation of this module is available to create a full-featured API for node.js with express.**

You can find it at [***api-m77-raspberry-wifi-node-nmcli***](https://github.com/mangos77/api-m77-raspberry-wifi-node-nmcli)

___


### Because?

Because I have benefited a lot from the work of other people and organizations that offer development modules and I want to give something back to the community.

I have dedicated several hours to trying to provide the necessary functionalities for correct application development in node.js.

I hope you find it very useful and recommend it so that it reaches more developers :-)

## Install
```
npm install m77-raspberry-wifi-node-nmcli
```

## Use
In order to initialize the module, you must first import it, create an instance and initialize **(in an asynchronous function)** with the desired configuration
```
const M77RaspberryWIFI = require('m77-raspberry-wifi-node-nmcli')
const wifi = new M77RaspberryWIFI()

async function start() {
    const init = await wifi.init()
}
start()
```

## Methods
*** **Important note: All methods are asynchronous**

### listInterfaces()
Auxiliary method to know which are the Wi-Fi interfaces of the system
```
const interfaces = await wifi.listInterfaces()
console.log(interfaces)
```
Response:
```
{
  success: true,
  msg: 'Wi-Fi interfaces found on the system',
  data: [ 'wlan0' ]
}
```
Error:
```
{ success: false, msg: `There are no Wi-Fi interfaces in the system.`, data: [] }
```

### init(options)
Initialize the interface and options to be able to use the other methods
options:
- *device* - The interface to use - default **wlan0**
- *debugLevel* - The debug level displayed in the console (0 - Nothing, 1 - Basic, 2 - Full) - Default **2**
- 
```
const init = await wifi.init({ device: "wlan0", debugLevel: 0 })
console.log(init)
```

Response:
```
{
  success: true,
  msg: 'Interface "wlan0" has been found on the system'
}
```

Error:
```
{
  success: false,
  msg: 'The "wlaan0" interface does not exist. Please execute the listInterfaces() method to get the list of available Wifi interfaces and set in init() method.'
}
```

### status(withConnectionInfo)
Show connection status on the interface
Options:
- *withConnectionInfo* - If **true** shows additional information about the established connection - default **false**


```
const status = await wifi.status()
console.log(status)
```

Response:
***No connection established***
```

  data: { milliseconds: 25831, ssid: 'mangos77' }
}
```

### reconnect(configuraciÃ³n)
Method that attempts to reconnect with a previously saved Wi-Fi network.

  success: false,
  msg: 'Could not reconnect to SSID "other_net" on interface wlan0, because the "other_net" network is not in those previously saved in the system',
  data: { milliseconds: 146, ssid: 'other_net' }
}
```

### disconnect()
